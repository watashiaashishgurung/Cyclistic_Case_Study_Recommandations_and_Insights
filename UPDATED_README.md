# Case Study: Cyclistic Dataset Analysis

First of all, thank you for visiting my hub. I appreciate you dropping by. This is my first real case study as a data scientist. I might have to update this case study in the future, but for now, I'm proud that I made it to the finish line.

The Cyclistic dataset was over 7GB in size, and going through it felt like going all the way back to the invention of the wheel! I hope you credit me for the effort in making this journey easier for you. Feel free to scroll through my code to find what you need to fine-tune your own case study. I'm sure you will appreciate the tools, tips, and tricks I collected along the way. They might come in handy. It is much more than you'll probably need, but I wrote them all just for the completion of the tasks.

I had much fun completing this case study. It was a very insightful journey. I am happy to reach the finish line. Good luck to you all! Cheers! Oh! You may want to use the same strategy for data analysis of other datasets.

## Tools for Data Analysis and Visualization

All the tools required for analyzing the dataset are provided in the `R_Formula_1` R file. This file contains all the necessary R code for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

For data visualization, I used Tableau Public. You can find the dashboard on the link to Tableau provided below.

Without further ado, here are my:

# Insights and Recommendations

## Seasonal and Weekly Trends
- From the timelines created on Tableau, we can see that most bikers prefer to ride during the second, third, and final quarters of the year.
- Subscribers' trip duration is fairly consistent during the week but tends to decrease on weekends. In contrast, customers ride more frequently on weekends.
- Peak trip durations for customers occur during the weekends of late summer, coinciding with the holiday season and the anticipation of a new academic year. The demand for bikes is highest due to various reasons:
  - Pleasant outside temperatures.
  - Increased traffic towards the end of the holiday season, necessitating quick and easy transportation.
  - Economic considerations, as people want to save money after the holiday season for other expenses like academic purchases. Biking can save on gas money.
  - Shorter days and longer nights make quick transportation more essential, and bikes are ideal for this purpose.

## Marketing Strategy
- Use digital media to promote our services, targeting different audiences based on their transportation needs:
  - "Joy riders" for sightseeing and outdoor activities.
  - "Functional riders" who want to save money and time.
  - Freshmen students who need both economical and quick transportation.

- Align the marketing campaign with the trip duration data visualizations on Tableau, akin to leading in a cycle race. Participation is more important than winning, but no one came this far just to stop now. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the view. We all deserve it by now.

## Addressing Low Customer Rates
- We have the fewest customers during the first months of the year. This can be attributed to the chilly weather, which discourages bike riding.
- To counter this, we can target "happy rebels" who enjoy the cold weather and "early birds" who want to burn holiday calories and start working on their summer bodies.

## Additional Services
- Referring to another case study, we can collaborate with "Bellabeat."
- We can offer an additional service with Bellabeat, a digital smartwatch that tracks trip activity and visualizes it on the customer's smartphone.

## Tableau Dashboard

This dashboard shows a yearly comparison between subscribers and customers bike rides in Seoul.

**Note:** This file still needs to be updated. My findings are not definitive yet. To be continued and completed with some R Markdown codes.

# Important Note!
Make sure that the Rebel is happy. When the Rebel is not happy, it is injurious to the economy. Healthy people spend more money because they have more money to spend. This requires physical, mental, and digital health.
