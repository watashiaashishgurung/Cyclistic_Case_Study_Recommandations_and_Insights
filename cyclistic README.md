First of all thank you for visitng my Hub. appriciate dropping by. 
this is my first real case study as a data scientist. I might have have to updates this case study in the future. For now I'm proud that I made the finish line.
The cyclistic dataset was over 7GM of size and going through it like I did was as if I had to go all the way back to the invention of the wheel!
I hope you guys credit me for the effort to make this journey, this task much easier for you. 
Feel free to scroll through my code to get just that what you need to fine tune your owncase study.
I'm sure you will appriciate the tools I collected. It might come in handly. It is much more then you'll probably need but I wrote them all just for the complition of the tasks. 
I had much fun completing this case study. It was a very insightfull jouney. I am happy to reach the finish line. Goodluck to you all! Cheers! 
oh! You may want to use the same strategy for data analysis use of other datasets. ;]

Without further ado.

# Insights and recommandations

We can see from the timelines I created on tableau that most bikers like to ride their bikes preferably during the second, the third and final quarter of the year. 

The subscribers tripduration us fairly consistent durinng the week but tend to ride lesser during the weekends. Whereas our customers ride bikes more fashionably during the weekends.

Most years we reach peak tripdurations of custumors during the weekends of late summer. 
This is because of the holiday season. And in anticipation of a new acadamical year. The demand for a bike then is the highest due to verious reason. 
## Here are some important factors.

- One of the reasons is the pleasent outside temperatures.
- Another reason is that as the traffic gets busier towards the end of the holidays season, people are in need of quick and easy means of transportation.
- Another factor that may convince our audience is to ride our bikes is for economical as the most people spent more money during the passed holiday season.
  People may want to save money for other spendings like acadamic puchases. People can save money buy saving gasmoney by riding our bikes.
- Another factor is that as the days get shorter, the darkness of the night may forces us to move quicker, people are more in need to get to places faster.
  a bike would be the ideal mean of transportation.

We can use digital media to promote our services targetting different audience based on their means of transportation, one way to do so is to make various commercials targetting 
"joy riders" for sight seening and outdoor activities, 
"functional rider" for riders who want to save money and time 
or freshmen students who are in need of both.

# Extra! The marketing campagne should be climactic aligned with the tripduration as shown on the data visualizations on Tableau as if we were in a cyclerace, leading examplary. 
Note! That there are only winners in the final and participation is more important than winning. But no one came this far just to come this far.. so then sitback, relax and enjoy the view.
At the end of the day we all deserve it by now.


Another trend I noticed is that we have the least cutomers during the first months of the years

Here we can assume it is because of the chilly weathers that our customers don't like to ride bikes.
Here we want to convince an audience who are like our "happy rebel" who enjoy the chill weather 
and those "early birds" who like to burn the calories from the passed holiday season and start working on their "summer body"
by making them our target audience of our marketing campagne. 

# additional services
Referring to the other case study we can colab with "Bellabeat".

We can provide an additional service of "Bellabeat", a digital smartwatch that tracks trip activity to and visualises it on the customers smartphone.
(this file still needs to be updated my findings are not definite (yet)) To be continued and to be completed with some R Markdown codes

# Important Note! 
Make sure that the Rebel is happy. When the rebel is not happy. That is injurious for the economy. Knowing healthy people spend more money because they have more money to spend.
